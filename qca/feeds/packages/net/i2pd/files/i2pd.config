config i2pd
	# Set where i2pd should store its data (netDB, certificates, addresses, etc)
	# By default we store it in RAM so no data is written to ROM.
	# IMPORTANT!
	# Data is consistently rewritten. DO NOT POINT IT TO INNER ROM. Flash will
	# die.
	option data_dir '/var/lib/i2pd'

	# If you don't store i2pd data permanently, you can still choose to store only
	# addressbook. If not, i2pd will be forced to do HTTP reseeding reseeding on
	# every start. Storing addressbook may be useful if HTTP reseeding is not
	# possible or blocked (by censorship).
	# Even addressbook doesn't take up too much space, extroot is still strongly
	# recommended to avoid flash wear-out.
	#option addressbook_dir '/etc/i2pd/addressbook'
