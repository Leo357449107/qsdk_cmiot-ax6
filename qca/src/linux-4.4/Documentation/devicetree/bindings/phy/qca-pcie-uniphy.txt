* PCIe UNIPHY controller

PCIe PHY nodes are defined to describe on-chip PCIe Physical layer controllers.
Each PCIe PHY controller should have its own node.

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: Value should contain "qca,uni-pcie-phy" or
			"qca,uni-pcie-phy-gen2" or "qca,uni-pcie-phy-gen3"

- phy-type:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: Value should contain "gen1"/"gen2"/"gen3"

- #phy-cells:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: Must be zero

- clocks:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: A list of phandles and clock specifier pair, one
		    for each entry in clock-names property

- clock-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: Should contain "core" for PHY core clock

- resets:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: List of phandle and reset specifier pairs as listed
		    in reset-names property

- reset-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: Should contain "core" for PHY core reset


* Example

	pcie_phy0: phy@86000 {
		compatible = "qca,uni-pcie-phy-gen3";
		phy-type = "gen3"
		#phy-cells = <0>;
		clocks = <&gcc GCC_PCIE0_PIPE_CLK>;
		clock-names = "pipe_clk";
		resets = <&gcc GCC_PCIE0_PHY_BCR>,
			<&gcc GCC_PCIE1PHY_PHY_BCR>;
		reset-names = "phy"
				"phy_phy";
	};
