Qualcomm Technologies Inc Embedded USB Debugger (EUD)

The EUD (Embedded USB Debugger) is a mini-USB hub implemented
on chip to support the USB-based debug and trace capabilities.

Required properties:

	- compatible:  Should be "qcom,msm-eud"
	- interrupt-names:  Should be "eud_irq"
	- interrupts:  Interrupt number
	- reg: Should be address and size of EUD register space
	- reg-names: Should be "eud_base"

Driver notifies clients via extcon for VBUS spoof attach/detach
and charger enable/disable events. Clients registered for these
notifications should have extcon property set to eud.

An example for EUD device node:

	eud: qcom,msm-eud@88e0000 {
		compatible = "qcom,msm-eud";
		interrupt-names = "eud_irq";
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 492 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		reg = <0x88e0000 0x4000>;
		reg-names = "eud_base";
	};

An example for EUD extcon client:

	usb3 {
		extcon = <&eud>;
	};
