QTI_SCM_RESTART_REASON

scm restart reason driver controls the collection of crashdump.
During panic/assert the notifiers registered in this driver will be kicked in
and the magic cookie is set, the crashdumps are collected in apps bootloader.

Required properties:
 - compatible: must contain "qti,scm_restart_reason" for IPQ40xx, IPQ807x

Optional properties:
 - dload_status: indicate whether memory is reserved for crashdump.
 - dload_sec_status: indicate whether crashdump is enabled for
   secure boot.
 - dload_warm_reset: set this property to 1 to retain IMEM data
   during warm reset. dload_status also should be set to 1 when
   setting this property to 1.
 - qti,runtime-failsafe: indicate whether runtime failsafe feature is enabled.
   This feature will be enabled in CDT, which will be read by SBL and passed
   to uboot via smem. Uboot patches it and passes to kernel.

Example for ipq40xx:

	qti,scm_restart_reason {
		compatible = "qti,scm_restart_reason";
		dload_status = <0>;
		dload_sec_status = <0>;
	};
