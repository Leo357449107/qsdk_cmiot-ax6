Application Processor Sub-system (APSS) Application Clock Controller (ACC)

The ACC provides clock, power domain, and reset control to a CPU. There is one ACC
register region per CPU within the APSS remapped region as well as an alias register
region that remaps accesses to the ACC associated with the CPU accessing the region.

Required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "qcom,arm-cortex-acc"
- reg:			The first element specifies the base address and size of
			the register region. An optional second element specifies
			the base address and size of the alias register region.

Example:

	clock-controller@b088000 {
		compatible = "qcom,arm-cortex-acc";
		reg = <0x0b088000 0x1000>,
		      <0x0b008000 0x1000>;
	}
