config DM_THERMAL
	bool "Driver support for thermal devices"
	help
	  Enable support for temporary-sensing devices. Some SoCs have on-chip
	  temperature sensors to permit warnings, speed throttling or even
	  automatic power-off when the temperature gets too high or low. Other
	  devices may be discrete but connected on a suitable bus.
