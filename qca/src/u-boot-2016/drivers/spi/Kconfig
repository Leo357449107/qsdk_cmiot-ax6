config DM_SPI
	bool "Enable Driver Model for SPI drivers"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Enable driver model for SPI. The SPI slave interface
	  (spi_setup_slave(), spi_xfer(), etc.) is then implemented by
	  the SPI uclass. Drivers provide methods to access the SPI
	  buses that they control. The uclass interface is defined in
	  include/spi.h. The existing spi_slave structure is attached
	  as 'parent data' to every slave on each bus. Slaves
	  typically use driver-private data instead of extending the
	  spi_slave structure.

config ALTERA_SPI
	bool "Altera SPI driver"
	help
	  Enable the Altera SPI driver. This driver can be used to
	  access the SPI NOR flash on platforms embedding this Altera
	  IP core. Please find details on the "Embedded Peripherals IP
	  User Guide" of Altera.

	help
	  Enable the Freescale DSPI driver. This driver can be used to
	  access the SPI NOR flash and SPI Data flash on platforms embedding
	  this Freescale DSPI IP core. LS102xA and Colibri VF50/VF61 platforms
	  use this driver.

	  Enable the Intel ICH SPI driver. This driver can be used to
	  access the SPI NOR flash on platforms embedding this Intel
	  ICH IP core.

config ROCKCHIP_SPI
	bool "Rockchip SPI driver"
	help
	  Enable the Rockchip SPI driver, used to access SPI NOR flash and
	  other SPI peripherals (such as the Chrome OS EC) on Rockchip SoCs.
	  This uses driver model and requires a device tree binding to
	  operate.

config SANDBOX_SPI
	bool "Sandbox SPI driver"
	depends on SANDBOX && DM
	help
	  Enable SPI support for sandbox. This is an emulation of a real SPI
	  bus. Devices can be attached to the bus using the device tree
	  which specifies the driver to use. As an example, see this device
	  tree fragment from sandbox.dts. It shows that the SPI bus has a
	  single flash device on chip select 0 which is emulated by the driver
	  for "sandbox,spi-flash", which is in drivers/mtd/spi/sandbox.c.

config TEGRA114_SPI
	bool "nVidia Tegra114 SPI driver"
	help
	  Enable the nVidia Tegra114 SPI driver. This driver can be used to
	  access the SPI NOR flash on platforms embedding this nVidia Tegra114
	  IP core.

	  This controller is different than the older SoCs SPI controller and
	  also register interface get changed with this controller.

config TEGRA20_SFLASH
	bool "nVidia Tegra20 Serial Flash controller driver"
	help
	  Enable the nVidia Tegra20 Serial Flash controller driver. This driver
	  can be used to access the SPI NOR flash on platforms embedding this
	  nVidia Tegra20 IP core.

config TEGRA20_SLINK
	bool "nVidia Tegra20/Tegra30 SLINK driver"
	help
	  Enable the nVidia Tegra20/Tegra30 SLINK driver. This driver can
	  be used to access the SPI NOR flash on platforms embedding this
	  nVidia Tegra20/Tegra30 IP cores.

config TEGRA210_QSPI
	bool "nVidia Tegra210 QSPI driver"
	help
	  Enable the Tegra Quad-SPI (QSPI) driver for T210. This driver
	  be used to access SPI chips on platforms embedding this
	  NVIDIA Tegra210 IP core.

config XILINX_SPI
	bool "Xilinx SPI driver"
	help
	  Enable the Xilinx SPI driver from the Xilinx EDK. This SPI
	  controller support 8 bit SPI transfers only, with or w/o FIFO.
	  For more info on Xilinx SPI Register Definitions and Overview
	  see driver file - drivers/spi/xilinx_spi.c

config ZYNQ_SPI

	  Enable the Zynq Quad-SPI (QSPI) driver. This driver can be
	  used to access the SPI NOR flash on platforms embedding this
	  Zynq QSPI IP core. This IP is used to connect the flash in
	  4-bit qspi, 8-bit dual stacked and shared 4-bit dual parallel.
