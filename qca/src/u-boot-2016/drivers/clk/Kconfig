config CLK
	bool "Enable clock driver support"
	depends on DM
	help
	  This allows drivers to be provided for clock generators, including
	  oscillators and PLLs. Devices can use a common clock API to request
	  a particular clock rate and check on available clocks. Clocks can
	  feed into other clocks in a tree structure, with multiplexers to
	  choose the source for each clock.

config SPL_CLK
	bool "Enable clock support in SPL"
	depends on CLK
	help
	  The clock subsystem adds a small amount of overhead to the image.
	  If this is acceptable and you have a need to use clock drivers in
	  SPL, enable this option. It might provide a cleaner interface to
	  setting up clocks within SPL, and allows the same drivers to be
	  used as U-Boot proper.
