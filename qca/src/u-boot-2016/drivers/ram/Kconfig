config RAM
	bool "Enable RAM drivers using Driver Model"
	depends on DM
	help
	  This allows drivers to be provided for SDRAM and other RAM
	  controllers and their type to be specified in the board's device
	  tree. Generally some parameters are required to set up the RAM and
	  the RAM size can either be statically defined or dynamically
	  detected.

config SPL_RAM
	bool "Enable RAM support in SPL"
	depends on RAM
	help
	  The RAM subsystem adds a small amount of overhead to the image.
	  If this is acceptable and you have a need to use RAM drivers in
	  SPL, enable this option. It might provide a cleaner interface to
	  setting up RAM (e.g. SDRAM / DDR) within SPL.
