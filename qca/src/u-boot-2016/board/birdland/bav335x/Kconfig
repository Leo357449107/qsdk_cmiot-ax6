	  The AM335x SoC has a total of 6 UARTs (UART0 to UART5 as referenced
	  in documentation, etc) available to it.  Depending on your specific
	  board you may want something other than UART0 as for example the IDK
	  uses UART3 so enter 4 here.

config BAV_VERSION
	int "BAV335x Version (1=A, 2=B)"
	range 1 2
	help
	  The BAV335x has various version of the board. Rev.A (mostly obsolete)
	  used 10/100 Ethernet PHY while Rev.B uses a Gigabit Ethernet PHY.
	  Overwrite this if you have an older Rev.A and want ethernet support.
