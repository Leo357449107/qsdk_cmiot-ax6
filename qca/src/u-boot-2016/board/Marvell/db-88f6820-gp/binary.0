WARNING:
--------
This file should contain the bin_hdr generated by the original Marvell
U-Boot implementation. As this is currently not included in this
U-Boot version, we have added this placeholder, so that the U-Boot
image can be generated without errors.

If you have a known to be working bin_hdr for your board, then you
just need to replace this text file here with the binary header
and recompile U-Boot.

In a few weeks, mainline U-Boot will get support to generate the
bin_hdr with the DDR training code itself. By implementing this code
as SPL U-Boot. Then this file will not be needed any more and will
get removed.
