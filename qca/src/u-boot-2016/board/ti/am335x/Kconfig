	  The AM335x SoC has a total of 6 UARTs (UART0 to UART5 as referenced
	  in documentation, etc) available to it.  Depending on your specific
	  board you may want something other than UART0 as for example the IDK
	  uses UART3 so enter 4 here.

config NOR
	bool "Support for NOR flash"
	help
	  The AM335x SoC supports having a NOR flash connected to the GPMC.
	  In practice this is seen as a NOR flash module connected to the
	  "memory cape" for the BeagleBone family.

config NOR_BOOT
	bool "Support for booting from NOR flash"
	depends on NOR
	help
	  Enabling this will make a U-Boot binary that is capable of being
	  booted via NOR.  In this case we will enable certain pinmux early
	  as the ROM only partially sets up pinmux.  We also default to using
	  NOR for environment.
