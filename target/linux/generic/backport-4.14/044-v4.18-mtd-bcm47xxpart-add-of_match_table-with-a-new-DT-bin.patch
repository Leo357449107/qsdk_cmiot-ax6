Subject: [PATCH] mtd: bcm47xxpart: add of_match_table with a new DT binding
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This allows using bcm47xxpart parser to find partitions on flash
described in DT using the "brcm,bcm947xx-cfe-partitions" compatible
property. It means this parser doesn't have to be explicitly selected by
a flash driver anymore. It can be used e.g. together with a generic
m25p80 / spi-nor if device is just properly described.
