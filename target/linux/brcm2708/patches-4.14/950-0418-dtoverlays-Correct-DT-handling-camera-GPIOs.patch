Subject: [PATCH 418/454] dtoverlays: Correct DT handling camera GPIOs

The firmware has support for updating overrides with the correct
GPIO settings for the camera GPIOs, but the wrong device tree
setup ended up being merged.
Correct the DT configuration so that the firmware does set it
up correctly.
