Subject: [PATCH 172/454] drm/vc4: Use correct path to trace include
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The header comment in include/trace/define_trace.h specifies that the
TRACE_INCLUDE_PATH needs to be relative to the define_trace.h header
rather than the trace file including it. Most instances get that wrong
and work around it by adding the $(src) directory to the include path.

While this works, it is preferable to refer to the correct path to the
trace file in the first place and avoid any workaround.
