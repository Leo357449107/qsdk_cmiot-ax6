Title: A lightweight DNS forwarder to populate ipsets

Description:  The ipset-dns daemon is a lightweight DNS forwarding server that adds all
 resolved IPs to a given netfilter ipset. It is designed to be used in
 conjunction with dnsmasq's upstream server directive.

 Practical use cases include routing over a given gateway traffic for
 particular web services or webpages that do not have a priori predictable
 IP addresses and instead rely on dizzying arrays of DNS resolutions.
