Description:   urngd is OpenWrt's micro non-physical true random number generator based on
  timing jitter.

  Using the Jitter RNG core, the rngd provides an entropy source that feeds into
  the Linux /dev/random device if its entropy runs low. It updates the
  /dev/random entropy estimator such that the newly provided entropy unblocks
  /dev/random.

  The seeding of /dev/random also ensures that /dev/urandom benefits from
  entropy. Especially during boot time, when the entropy of Linux is low, the
  Jitter RNGd provides a source of sufficient entropy.
