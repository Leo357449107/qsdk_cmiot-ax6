	help
	  Enable this option to re-include crypt() support for the SHA256, SHA512 and
	  Blowfish ciphers. Without this option, attempting to hash a string with a salt
	  requesting one of these ciphers will cause the crypt() function to call stub
	  implementations which will always fail with errno ENOSYS. Including the ciphers
	  will increase the library size by about 14KB after LZMA compression.
